%% Transformation of Camera and Object:

% Transform object to world coordinates
ObjectLines = T_ow*ObjectLines;

%Transform The Object to camera coordinates
ObjectLines = T_cw\ObjectLines;

% Projects out the 4th "dimension" and multiplies with intrinsic component
ObjectLines = KMatrix * ObjectLines(1:3,:);

%Normalizing the points. This involves dividing the points by their
%distances to the plane. This is because even though two points have the
%same x or y values for example, if they are in different distances away
%from you, they seem like they hae different x and y values. To get an
%intuition about this, think about two tress of the same size. One of them
%is 10 meters from you and the other one is 100 meters from you. The one
%furthest from you will look like it is smaller than the one close to you.
%The sizes are proportional to the distance, so the one 100 meters from you
%will look like 10 times smaller (this is proven by a simple triangle
%analysis) This is why here in this loop we divide the x and y values of
%the object lines (ObjectLines(1:2,j)) by their distances from the plane
%(ObjectLines(3,j)).
s = size(ObjectLines);
for j = 1:s(2)
   ObjectLines(1:2,j)  = ObjectLines(1:2,j)/ObjectLines(3,j);
